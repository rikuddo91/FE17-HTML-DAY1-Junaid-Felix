    <h1> Yesterday</h1>

<div><span>Yesterday</span>, all my troubles seemed so far away<br>
Now it looks as though they′re here to stay<br>
Oh, I believe in <span>yesterday</span><br>

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be<br>
There′s a shadow hanging over me<br>
<br>

Oh, <span>yesterday</span> came suddenly<br>


Why she had to go<br>
I don't know, she wouldn't say<br>
I said something wrong<br>
Now I long for <span>yesterday</span></div><br>

<div id="refrain">Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br>
Now I need a place to hide away<br>
Oh, I believe in yesterday</div><br>

<div>Why she had to go<br>
I don′t know, she wouldn′t say<br>

Now I long for <span>yesterday</span></div><br>

<div id="refrain">Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br>
Now I need a place to hide away<br>
